============= Puppet TextMate Bundle ==============

This is a TextMate (http://www.macromates.com/) bundle for 
Puppet manifests.

It is very limited for the moment and only offer a few syntax highlighting
and a comment preference.

To install, clone this repository and drag the Puppet.tmbundle directory
on the TextMate icon. The installation will then be automatic.
